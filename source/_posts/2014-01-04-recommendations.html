		<p>Mark an exceptional hands-on manager. He completely understands the issues his instructors face in the labs and relates to them at their level.</p>
		<p>Mark allows his instructors the freedom to do what they do best: design and deliver a course to the best of their abilities and to the maximum benefit of the students.</p>
		<p>Because of these reasons, and because of Mark's good nature, I look forward to working with him for many more years. </p>
